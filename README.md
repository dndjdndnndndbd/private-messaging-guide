# Private Messaging Guide
A complete, objective and unbiased guide to secure and private online communications.

This guide will cover all common online communication technologies and services, compare them, and sort them into one of 5 different groups based on privacy, security, and anonymity. The guide also covers many of the services from the perspective of user-friendliness, digital rights/freedom, , reliability, and company credibility.

# The 5 groups
Group A - Services with nearly perfect privacy. Usually peer-to-peer, highly recommended for sensitive tasks.

Group B - Servics with good privacy. Usually peer-to-peer, or at least decentralized, generally trustable for sensitive tasks.

Group C - Services with above-average privacy. Usually peer-to-peer, decentralized, or at least end-to-end encrypted, not bad for sensitive tasks, but higher grade options are recommended.

Group D - Services with average privacy. Usually either unencrypted, or store too much metadata. Not recommended for sensitive tasks.
